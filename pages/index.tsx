        the "imageName" parameter isnt yet functional.
        the idea of it is to allow you to input an image's source where ever
        you use a card, so it can change. whenever i try n make the "src" equal to the "imageName" argument,
        i get prompted with some stupid silly error about the width not being specified and im not too sure
        how to fix it. you can give it a shot though
